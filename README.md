# Password-Generator

A random Password Generator created by Jordan Sarvay

When the generate password button is pressed, the user is faced with 5 prompts
	-how long is the password (between 8 and 128 characters)
	-would they like to include lower case letters?
	-would they like to include upper case letters?
	-would they like to include numbers?
	-would they like to include special characters?

Once these prompts are answered, a bank of usable characters is created as a variable from which we can randomly select to create a password based on user submitted length.

Once the password is generated, it is pushed to the text box on the page.

This may be repeated without having to reload the page.
